# Rubem Novellino

Welcome to my page everyone!

As a civil engineer I started my studies in Brazil and ended up in France and then I became a data science specialist and Anbima investiment specialist (CEA) while working with financial consultancy for individuals.
In addition to being passionate about the financial market and with an insatiable curiosity, I am always looking for more knowledge, new challenges and new certifications to continue serving those who hire my services in the best way.
All this transforming the lives of more than 70 families and with more than 2.5 Mi of assets under guidance to optimize the achievement of goals.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a resident in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence where I am participating in the development of an automation application for HC-UFPE, we used various skills to design a customized solution that meets the institution's needs. Our goal is to apply innovative technologies to optimize processes and improve the operational efficiency of the institution, ensuring that the solution is highly scalable and modular for a complex challenge. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for Data Science, using libraries like Pandas and Numpy
